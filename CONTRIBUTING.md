# Contributing

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue at https://github.com/ipscanner/ipscanner-cloudflare/issues. Include the version you use, what you expected, what happened, and the smallest example that reproduces it.

Report security issues privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Proposing changes

Open a pull request against `main`. For larger changes, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.

## Code and tests

- Every new feature or bug fix comes with tests.
- CI must pass before a pull request is merged.
- Follow the existing code style.

Run the same checks as CI before you push:

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```
